        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Fashion_Week" target="_blank">NYFW</a> can be both amazingly fun and incredibly overwhelming, especially if you;ve never been. 
        Luckily, I'm here to give you an insider's guide and make your first show an incredible 
        experience. By taking my tips and tricks, and following your gut, you'll have an 
        unforgettable experience!

    <h2>Getting Tickets and Picking the Shows</h2>

        If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn't so 
        lucky or conneected the first 2 years so I'm here to help you out. First, plan out which shows 
        are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you're 
        worried about blowing your cash the whole time  you won't have fun. Then check out the prices
        , days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your 
        tickets and get excited.

    <h2>Dressing for the Shows</h2>

        Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don't you'll be uncomfortable the whole time 
        and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself, and taking in what the designers 
        have chosen to expressthrough their new lines. Also  it's important to wear shoes you'll be 
        comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but you'll be on your feet all day long,
        so be prepared.
